Welcome to the Starlight GitHub page! Here, you will find all references used in my videos and all the code I create for the Manim visualizations. 

Use the branches list to pick a video series by its title, and feel free to use the code in your own projects!

This tree stores the code and reference list for my YouTube Series "Why do stars die?"

Feel free to take my code and manipulate it as you want!
